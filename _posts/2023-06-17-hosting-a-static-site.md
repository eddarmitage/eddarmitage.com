title: "Hosting a static site"
---

I've wanted to host a simple little website for many years now, but never had the inclination to invest too much (be
it in terms of time, money or thought) into it - the obvious solution was to serve some kind of pre-baked static site,
removing the need for any real kind of infrastructure maintenance, leaving me to worry about "content" (whatever that
means).
