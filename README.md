# Site contents for eddarmitage.com

It's built using GitHub pages, and served via Cloudflare. I've written more details about how I set that up in a blog
post that you can read.

Because it's built using GitHub Pages, it's a Jekyll site, and I've kept with the default minima theme. GitHub seems to
currently be using v2.5.1 of this theme, so the documentation is available [here][Minima-docs].
